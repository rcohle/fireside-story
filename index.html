    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Drivivng down the road with your partner your tire goes flat. You remember a spooky castle you recently passed and decide to go use their phone</p>
    <p>Your partner hesitates at going in, but you convince them that you need to! Strangely, the door automatically opens as you approach it.</p>
    <p>You step inside to see a slim man with sunken eyes. His long blonde hair an unkempt mess. A creepy maid throws him a feather duster and they break into song and dance</p>
